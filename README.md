# SpeedySpec Event Library

Functional Reactive Programming library in PHP.

Signals are streams that accept any data to be combined using the functional methods.

Need to create tests. Going to attempt to match bacon.js along with the RxJava and iOS reactive library.

The goal is to implement a more modern functional reactive library.
